This is my project, which I named Random Ride. The problem attempts to solve going on the same bike or walk route every time you go out. What I have right now is a program that allows users to put points on the loaded google map to plan out their route. After each point is placed the distance is calculated in miles and is shown on the marker. There is also an option to use current location or entered a desired starting address. I used google maps api, and tested with mapbox, to create an app that was able to use a map and ended up using google maps. Being able to snap the routes to roads was a difficult api web request that I did not have enough time for, but I think what I have right now is pretty good for not using android studio or a map api before. Each api had different features that could have helped but they cost money and I didnt find them out until I had gotten pretty far into my code so I would of had to start over.


The project was done in android studio and it should be able to be downloaded and run in android studio.

How to use: It is pretty straight forward, but you can use your current location(which does not work for android emulations unless you change ur gps location) or a given address. To use a given address you just put the address or city in the search bar and click the search icon then you click on the button that says use address.
